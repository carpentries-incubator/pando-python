# Profiling & Optimisation (Python)

## Introduction

This lesson introduces the basics of profiling and optimising Python code. The course is designed to be accessible to Python users of all skill levels (beyond total beginner). The optimisations presented should be considered performance best practices, they are demonstrated with small programming patterns that demonstrate multiple approaches in code to achieve the same result with differing performance.
